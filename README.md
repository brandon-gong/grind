# `grind`
`grind` is an ultra-simple CLI tool to help schedule reviews of LeetCode (or HackerRank, or Codeforces, etc)
practice problems using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), a proven
method for effective learning and long-term retention.

It is still in testing phase, and more information on installation and usage will be added here soon.
