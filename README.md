# `grind`
`grind` is an ultra-simple CLI tool to help schedule reviews of LeetCode (or HackerRank, or Codeforces, etc)
practice problems using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), a proven
method for effective learning and long-term retention. It is based on the
[SuperMemo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo) algorithm, a variant of which is used by the widely
popular flashcard app Anki.

It is still in testing phase, and more information on installation and usage will be added here soon.
If you are interested in testing it out yourself, clone the responsitory and add it to your `$PATH`.
Then, run `grind`, or `grind help` to see other options.
